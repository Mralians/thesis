# Live system call trace reconstruction on Linux

1. performance degradation can be used by the malware itself to detect it is being monitored and attempt to hide its presence in the system. Therefore, existing intrusive `VMI` methods limit the applicability of system call tracing in production systems.

2. Malicious software, like malware, sometimes behaves differently when it senses that it's being watched or monitored. When monitoring tools cause a noticeable slowdown in the performance of the system (like making the computer run more slowly), some types of malware may detect this change and interpret it as a sign that they are being observed.

   In response to this, the malware might take actions to avoid detection, such as becoming less active or trying to hide its presence on the computer. Essentially, it's like the malware realizing it's under scrutiny and trying to act less suspicious to avoid getting caught by security measures. So, the performance degradation, which is a side effect of monitoring, can inadvertently tip off the malware and cause it to change its behavior to avoid detection.

3. Malware can detect performance degradation in a few ways, primarily by monitoring resource usage like memory and CPU. It doesn't perform complex calculations, but it observes changes in system behavior. Here's how it works:

   1. **Resource Usage Monitoring:** Malware can monitor the amount of system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage) it consumes. When monitoring tools or security software are active, they may cause additional resource usage, which the malware can detect.

   2. **Timing and Patterns:** Malware can also keep track of the timing and patterns of its actions. If it typically operates quickly but suddenly slows down, it might interpret this as a sign that something is amiss.

   3. **System Calls:** Malware can observe system calls it makes to the operating system. If it's making system calls that it doesn't usually need to make, it might consider this a sign that it's being monitored.

   4. **Network Activity:** Some malware communicates with command and control servers on the internet. When it senses a slowdown, it may reduce or change its network activity to avoid attracting attention.

   5. **Behavior Analysis:** Modern security solutions employ behavior-based detection. Malware can notice that its usual behavior is being tracked or that certain actions trigger alarms.

   6. **Antivirus Software Interference:** Malware often keeps tabs on the presence of antivirus or security software. If it detects interference or increased activity from these programs, it might take evasive action.

   while malware can detect changes in system behavior, it doesn't perform complex calculations. Instead, it relies on simple indicators and patterns to determine if it's under observation and then takes actions to avoid detection.

4. trying to monitor or trace system calls in a virtual machine without disturbing its normal operation is a challenging job.

5. A tracer, which is a tool used for monitoring and recording system  calls, should not disrupt or affect the virtual machine's performance  while it's running.

6. If there's no specialized hardware assistance available, non-intrusive  tracing methods need to use a separate process (a "thread") that  constantly watches and records the system calls being made by the  programs running in the virtual machine.

7. Even though this separate thread is watching for system calls, it needs  to work quickly. It must be faster than the actual system calls  themselves. In other words, the tracing process must keep up with the  speed at which the programs in the virtual machine are making system  calls.

8. If the tracing process isn't faster than the system calls, it might not be able to record them accurately. The sentence refers to a specific section in a document where this problem is explained in more detail.

9. programs frequently make use of system calls, which are essential for  various operations. Modern processors are designed to make the execution of system calls as fast as possible, reducing the time it takes to  complete them. 

10. For example, the `getpid()` system call completes in 61 nano-seconds. As an illustration, the sentence gives the example of the `getpid()` system call, which is a very fast system call and typically takes just 61 billionths of a second to execute.

11. In contrast, methods that involve analyzing an entire raw memory image  (a snapshot of a system's memory) typically take much longer than 61  nanoseconds.

12. **System Calls:** When a program makes a system call, like the `getpid()` system call, it is typically very fast and can complete in a matter of nanoseconds. For example, the `getpid()` call mentioned in the text takes only 61 nanoseconds (billionths of a second) to execute. System calls are essential for programs to interact with the operating system and perform tasks like reading files, creating processes, or allocating memory. Because these calls are heavily used and very efficient, they are a fundamental part of program execution.

13. **Analyzing Raw Memory Images:** On the other hand, analyzing an entire raw memory image of a system is a much more time-consuming process. A raw memory image is essentially a snapshot of the entire system's memory, capturing the contents of RAM at a specific moment in time. Analyzing this memory image involves examining every piece of data stored in memory, which can be vast and complex. This process requires reading and processing a large amount of data, which takes considerably more time compared to the rapid execution of a single system call.

So, the key point is that while system calls are very fast and efficient operations, analyzing the entire memory image of a system is much slower because it involves processing a significant amount of data. The sentence is emphasizing this difference to highlight the challenges associated with tracing system calls in a non-intrusive manner without causing significant delays or interfering with the system's normal operation.

14. When you take a snapshot of a system's memory (a raw memory image) using methods like memory forensics or memory acquisition tools, you typically capture the state of the entire system at a specific moment in time. This snapshot reflects the contents of memory, including program data, at the time the snapshot is taken.

    If you were to examine this memory image after taking the snapshot, you might find data associated with system calls that were made in the past, but you would not capture the actual execution of a specific system call like `getpid()` as it happens in real-time.

    System calls are executed by a running program, and they typically complete very quickly, often in nanoseconds. The act of taking a snapshot, which captures the entire memory state, is not fast enough to capture the individual, very brief execution of a system call like `getpid()` because it's a momentary event.

    To monitor or trace the execution of system calls in real-time, you would typically use specialized tools like `strace` or `ptrace` on Linux, which allow you to intercept and log system calls as they happen. Capturing system call activity from a memory snapshot is not a common or straightforward task, as it usually involves real-time tracing methods.

15. In contrast, methods that involve analyzing an entire raw memory image  (a snapshot of a system's memory) typically take much longer than 61  nanoseconds.

16. the time it takes for `LibVMI` to acquire a 4 KB page of memory is much  longer than the time it takes for standard system calls to execute.

17. Because `LibVMI` is slower than system calls, it's not a suitable choice  for non-intrusive (unobtrusive) tracing of system calls. **Non-intrusive  tracing methods should ideally not interfere with the normal operation  of the system or slow it down significantly.**

18. Previous research, referenced as work by `Pagani` and `Voâ‚¬mel`, has  demonstrated that acquiring a memory image that's suitable for forensics or detailed analysis is a complex task. It's not a simple or  straightforward process.

19. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of our method for a non-intrusive system call tracing on live VMs running the Linux `x86_64` OS.

20. this OS is popularly used by enterprises and offered by major cloud vendors.

21. We overcome the challenge of implementing a non-intrusive tracer that is faster than any Linux system call as follows.

    1. identify the precise physical memory locations (physical addresses)  where the CPU registers store information related to system calls. We  achieve this by keeping a cached record of the translation between  virtual addresses (the addresses used by programs) and physical  addresses (the actual locations in memory). This information is  essential for tracking system calls.
    2. our tool shares the physical memory addresses it has identified with a dedicated memory sampling framework. This framework is designed  and integrated into the QEMU hypervisor. QEMU is a widely used  virtualization and emulation software. The memory sampling framework  collects data from these addresses as part of its operation.
    3. In the final step, developed an innovative method. This method allows us to use the values stored in these registers for two purposes:
       - **Detecting system call execution:** They monitor the registers to determine when a system call is being executed.
       - **Recovering system call information:** They also extract information about the system call itself from these registers.
    4. This approach is efficient and quick enough to capture complete system traces, including system calls, for commonly used applications. The details of their approach's performance and results are discussed in a later section of the document (Section Evaluation).
